RACHEL
Thanks for meeting me here.
(re: women)
Don’t worry about them. They’re half deaf and they only speak Hokkien.
WOMAN
(hands Eleanor dice)
Mm-hmm.
RACHEL
My mom taught me how to play. She told me mahjong would teach me important life skills. Negotiation, strategy, cooperation.
ELEANOR
You asked me here. I assume it’s not for a mahjong lesson. Pung.
ELEANOR
My mother taught me, too.
RACHEL
I know Nick told you the truth about my mom. But you didn’t like me the second I got here. Why is that?
ELEANOR
There’s a Hokkien phrase. Ka gi lan. It means ‘our own kind of people.’ And you’re not our own kind.
RACHEL
‘Cause I’m not rich? ‘Cause I didn’t go to a British boarding school or I wasn’t born into a wealthy family?

ELEANOR
You’re a foreigner. American. And all Americans think about is their own happiness.
RACHEL
Don’t you want Nick to be happy?
ELEANOR
It’s an illusion. We understand how to build things that last. Something you know nothing about.
RACHEL
You don’t know me.
ELEANOR
I know you’re not what Nick needs.
RACHEL
Well, he proposed to me yesterday.
(off Eleanor)
He said he’d walk away from his family and from you, for good.
RACHEL
Don’t worry, I turned him down.
ELEANOR
Only a fool folds a winning hand.
RACHEL
There’s no winning. You made sure of that. Because if Nick chose me, he would lose his family. And if he chose his family, he spend the rest of his life resenting you.
ELEANOR (realizing)
So you chose for him.
RACHEL
I’m not leaving ‘cause I’m cared or because I think I’m not enough. Because... maybe for the first time in my life, I know I am.

RACHEL (CONT'D)
(beat)
I just love Nick so much. I don't want him to lose his mom again. So I just wanted you to know that one day, when he marries another lucky girl, who is enough for you, and you're playing with your grandkids while the tan huas are blooming, and the birds are chirping, that it was because of me... a poor, raised by a single mother, low class, immigrant nobody
INT. ASTRID’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
MICHAEL
Hey. I'm gonna send someone for the rest of my stuff. But I wanna talk to you about my visitation rights with Cassian.
ASTRID
Stop talking.
MICHAEL
What?
ASTRID
Don’t worry about packing your things. You bought this apartment, you keep it. We’re leaving --
MICHAEL
What do you mean, you're leaving?
Where are you gonna go?
ASTRID
I have fourteen apartment buildings that I own, so probably one of those.
